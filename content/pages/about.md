I'm a roboticist, currently working as a motion planning research engineer at [Brain Corporation](https://www.braincorp.com).

I have a Master's degree in Robotics from the University of Pennsylvania. While at University, I was a part of the [DAIR Lab](https://dair.seas.upenn.edu), working on optimal control for bipedal robots.

My interests lie in enabling robots to function autonomously in the real world, using planning, optimization and learning based approaches.

Brief descriptions of some of my projects can be found [here](/pages/projects). Repositories for all my projects can be accessed through my [GitHub](https://github.com/shrenikm) page.
